            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History & Origin</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Pickleball was invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, a short ferry ride from Seattle, Washington. Three
              dads – Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum – created the game for their families who were bored
              during summer vacation.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              The original purpose was to provide a game that the whole family could play together. The Pritchard
              property had an old badminton court, but they couldn't find enough rackets for everyone to play. They
              improvised with ping-pong paddles and a perforated plastic ball.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How the Game Got Its Name</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">There are two stories about how pickleball got its name:</p>

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>The Dog Theory:</strong> According to Joel Pritchard's wife Joan, she started calling the game
                pickleball because "the combination of different sports reminded me of the pickle boat in crew where
                oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Dog Theory:</strong> The Pritchards had a dog named Pickles who would chase after the ball
                and run off with it. Hence, "Pickles' ball" which was later shortened to "pickleball."
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Growth & Popularity</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              From its humble beginnings, pickleball has grown to become one of the fastest-growing sports in America.
              According to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA), pickleball participation grew by 39.3% from
              2019 to 2021.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Today, the sport is played in thousands of locations across the United States and is gaining popularity
              internationally as well. The USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) was formed in 1984 to promote the growth
              and development of the sport.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">What is Pickleball?</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Pickleball is a paddle sport that combines elements of badminton, tennis, and table tennis. It's played
                both indoors and outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net.
              </p>
              <p>
                Players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated polymer ball over the
                net.
