            <h2>Essential Strategies for All Skill Levels</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're a beginner or an advanced player, these strategies will help you improve your game and win more matches.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Master the Serve:</strong> Focus on consistency rather than power. A good serve is one that lands deep in the opponent's service court.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remember the Two-Bounce Rule:</strong> The serve must bounce, and the return of serve must bounce before either team can volley the ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Get to the Non-Volley Zone Line:</strong> After the two bounces, both teams should move forward to the non-volley zone line (kitchen line) for the best court position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep the Ball in Play:</strong> Consistency is key. Focus on returning the ball rather than trying to hit winners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch the Ball:</strong> Keep your eye on the ball all the way to your paddle. This improves accuracy and timing.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Intermediate Strategies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Third Shot Drop:</strong> After serving and receiving the return, hit a soft shot that lands in the opponent's non-volley zone. This prevents them from attacking and gives your team time to move forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dinking Game:</strong> Practice soft shots that just clear the net and land in the opponent's non-volley zone. This creates opportunities for your opponent to make errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Court Positioning:</strong> In doubles, partners should move as a unit, staying side by side and adjusting positions based on where the ball is hit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shot Selection:</strong> Learn when to hit soft shots (dinks) versus when to attack with power. Generally, hit down on balls above net height and lift balls that are below net height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication:</strong> Call out "mine" or "yours" to avoid confusion with your partner. Also communicate strategy between points.
                </li>
            </ol>
