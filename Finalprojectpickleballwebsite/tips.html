            <h2>Essential Strategies for All Skill Levels</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're a beginner or an advanced player, these strategies will help you improve your game and win more matches.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Master the Serve:</strong> Focus on consistency rather than power. A good serve is one that lands deep in the opponent's service court.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remember the Two-Bounce Rule:</strong> The serve must bounce, and the return of serve must bounce before either team can volley the ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Get to the Non-Volley Zone Line:</strong> After the two bounces, both teams should move forward to the non-volley zone line (kitchen line) for the best court position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep the Ball in Play:</strong> Consistency is key. Focus on returning the ball rather than trying to hit winners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch the Ball:</strong> Keep your eye on the ball all the way to your paddle. This improves accuracy and timing.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Intermediate Strategies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Third Shot Drop:</strong> After serving and receiving the return, hit a soft shot that lands in the opponent's non-volley zone. This prevents them from attacking and gives your team time to move forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dinking Game:</strong> Practice soft shots that just clear the net and land in the opponent's non-volley zone. This creates opportunities for your opponent to make errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Court Positioning:</strong> In doubles, partners should move as a unit, staying side by side and adjusting positions based on where the ball is hit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shot Selection:</strong> Learn when to hit soft shots (dinks) versus when to attack with power. Generally, hit down on balls above net height and lift balls that are below net height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication:</strong> Call out "mine" or "yours" to avoid confusion with your partner. Also communicate strategy between points.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stacking:</strong> A strategy where partners position themselves to maintain their preferred sides of the court regardless of the score.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Erne Shot:</strong> A volley hit near the net post while standing outside the non-volley zone. This shot can surprise opponents and create winning opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Around-the-Post (ATP) Shot:</strong> Hitting the ball around the net post rather than over the net. This is legal as long as the ball lands in bounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spin Shots:</strong> Adding topspin, backspin, or sidespin to your shots can make them more difficult for opponents to return effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Poaching:</strong> When a player crosses over to their partner's side to hit the ball, usually to attack a weak return.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Mental Game Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay Positive:</strong> Maintain a positive attitude even after making errors. Negative emotions can affect your performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focus on the Present:</strong> Don't dwell on past points or worry about the score. Focus on the current point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop Routines:</strong> Create pre-serve routines to help maintain focus and consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyze Opponents:</strong> Identify and exploit your opponents' weaknesses while being aware of their strengths.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Practice Deliberately:</strong> When practicing, focus on specific skills rather than just playing games.
                </li>
            </ul>
