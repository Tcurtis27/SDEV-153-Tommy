            <h2>Basic Rules of Pickleball</h2>
            <p>
                Pickleball is played on a badminton-sized court (20' x 44') with a modified tennis net. The game can be played as singles or doubles, 
                with doubles being the most common format.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Court</h3>
            <p>
                The pickleball court is divided into sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen):</strong> A 7-foot area on each side of the net where players cannot volley the ball (hit it in the air without letting it bounce).</li>
                <li><strong>Right/Even Service Court:</strong> The area to the right of the center line, as you face the net.</li>
                <li><strong>Left/Odd Service Court:</strong> The area to the left of the center line, as you face the net.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> The back line of the court.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Serving Rules</h3>
            <p>
                The serve must be made underhand and below waist level:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The server must keep one foot behind the baseline during the serve.</li>
                <li>The serve is made diagonally to the opponent's service court.</li>
                <li>Only one serve attempt is allowed (except if the ball touches the net and lands in the correct service court, which is a "let" and is reserved).</li>
                <li>The serving team can only score points.</li>
                <li>In doubles, both players on a team serve before the serve passes to the opponents (except for the first service sequence of each game).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>The Two-Bounce Rule</h3>
            <p>
                After the serve:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The receiving team must let the ball bounce once before returning it.</li>
                <li>The serving team must then let the return bounce once before hitting it.</li>
                <li>After these two bounces, the ball can be volleyed or played off the bounce.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>
                Games are typically played to 11 points, and a team must win by 2 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                In doubles, the score is called out as three numbers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The serving team's score</li>
                <li>The receiving team's score</li>
                <li>The server number (1 or 2, indicating which player on the team is serving)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Faults</h3>
            <p>
                A fault occurs when:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ball is hit out of bounds</li>
                <li>The ball does not clear the net</li>
                <li>The ball is volleyed in the non-volley zone (kitchen)</li>
                <li>The ball is volleyed before the two-bounce rule is satisfied</li>
                <li>A player touches the net or the non-volley zone while volleying the ball</li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    Pickleball combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. The rules are simple and the game is easy to learn, but can develop into a fast-paced, competitive game for experienced players.
