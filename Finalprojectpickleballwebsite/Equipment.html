            <h3>Pickleball Paddles</h3>
            <p>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Wood</td>
                        <td>10-15 oz</td>

                        <td>Beginners, recreational play</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Composite</td>
                        <td>7-9 oz</td>
                        <td>$50-$100</td>
                        <td>Intermediate players</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>
                When choosing a paddle, consider these factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Heavier paddles provide more power, lighter paddles offer more control.</li>

                <li><strong>Face Material:</strong> Affects power, control, and spin capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Core Material:</strong> Polymer cores are most common and provide a good balance of power and control.</li>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indoor Balls:</strong> Lighter with smaller holes, designed for indoor play on gym floors.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor Balls:</strong> Heavier with larger holes, designed to withstand wind and outdoor conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Official tournament balls must meet USAPA specifications for size, weight, and bounce height.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Footwear</h3>
            <p>
                Proper court shoes are essential for preventing injuries and improving performance:

            <ul>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Accessories</h3>
            <p>
                These additional items can enhance your pickleball experience:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paddle Cover:</strong> Protects your paddle when not in use.</li>
                <li><strong>Grip Tape:</strong> Replacement grip or overgrip to maintain good paddle control.</li>
                <li><strong>Pickleball Bag:</strong> Specialized bags to carry paddles, balls, and accessories.</li>
                <li><strong>Sweatbands:</strong> Wristbands and headbands to keep sweat out of your eyes and hands.</li>
